# CLAUDE.md.template

<!--
MERGE INSTRUCTIONS:
This template adds the RPI workflow to your project. Merge these sections
into your existing CLAUDE.md (generated by /init), then delete this file.

If no CLAUDE.md exists yet, rename this file to CLAUDE.md and run /init
to auto-detect your project's language, build system, and test framework.

<!-- KEEP your existing Project Overview from /init above this line -->

## Development Workflow

This project uses the Claude Code RPI Plus workflow:

1. **Research**: `/research_codebase` before changes
2. **Plan**: `/create_plan` for non-trivial work (requires approval)
3. **Implement**: `/implement_plan` with phase gates
4. **Verify**: `/phase_complete` before commit
5. **Commit**: `/gitsync` to push

## Constraints

<!-- Project-specific rules that /init won't detect -->

- [Add your constraints here]

## Configuration

- `.claude/portable_config.local.yaml` - Project settings (test command, paths)
- `.claude/rules/` - Behavioral constraints (auto-loaded)
- `docs/state/RESUME.md` - Session continuity
